## <a href="https://avrae-ui.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Avrae Command Builder</a>

A user friendly interface for creating Avrae commands. Click a command from a list of options, then fill in the input boxes. Great for teaching beginners, and for advanced users to create long commands on the fly.
